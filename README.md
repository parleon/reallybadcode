# reallybadcode

files were originally in individual directories, since I uploaded both simultaneously package name will clash, so run with one file in cd. 

compile using "go build {name of file}"

run using ./{name of executable} x
where x is total numbers

note: I lost a lot of time trying to create an array of fixed length using a variable. I am pretty sure this is impossible since arrays are supposed to be initialized with constants. 

I would not be able to answer if the big-o analysis of sort and stable is valid since I haven't had time to properly test, nor do I know if my code is valid.
